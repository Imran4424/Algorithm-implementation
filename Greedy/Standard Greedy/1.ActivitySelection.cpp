	You are given n activities with their start and finish times. Select 
	the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person, 
	assuming that a person can only work on a single activity at a time.

	Example 1 : Consider the following 3 activities sorted by start and
	by finish time.

	     start[]  =  {10, 12, 20};
	     finish[] =  {20, 25, 30};

	A person can perform at most two activities. The 
	maximum set of activities that can be executed 
	is {0, 2} [ These are indexes in start[] and 
	finish[] ]

	Example 2 : Consider the following 6 activities sorted by start and 
	finish time.

	     start[]  =  {1, 3, 0, 5, 8, 5};
	     finish[] =  {2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 9};

	A person can perform at most four activities. The 
	maximum set of activities that can be executed 
	is {0, 1, 3, 4} [ These are indexes in start[] and 
	finish[] ]
