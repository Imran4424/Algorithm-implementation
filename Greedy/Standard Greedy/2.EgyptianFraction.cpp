	A fraction is unit fraction if numerator is 1 and denominator is a positive 
	integer, for example 1/3 is a unit fraction. Such a representation is called 
	Egyptian Fraction as it was used by ancient Egyptians.

	Egyptian Fraction Representation of 2/3 is 1/2 + 1/6
	Egyptian Fraction Representation of 6/14 is 1/3 + 1/11 + 1/231
	Egyptian Fraction Representation of 12/13 is 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/12 + 1/156
